# Mapping_Earthquakes

# Project Overview
Maps allow us to explore, understand, and make decisions about our world. In this repository we will use javascript (GeoJSON) to create interactive maps to visualize earthquake data. GeoJSON data can be found in many apps that have a map feature such as ride-sharing, navigation, and food and package delivery services. Even location services on smart phones use GeoSJON format.

# Project Purpose
The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.
